        I am Jessica, a front-end developer with 7 years of experience. My
        journey to becoming a developer was not always easy, but it was
        definitely worth the effort. With a background in design, I learned the
        importance of attention to detail and disciplined work ethic, and I
        apply those principles to my code every day. I am passionate about
        creating user-friendly interfaces that solve problems and make
        people&apos;s lives easier. I am proud of my ability to work through
        challenges and consistently deliver high-quality, successful projects.
